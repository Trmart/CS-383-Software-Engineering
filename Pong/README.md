## Installing Unity
-------------------
- Go to Unity’s Download Page and click “Download Installer for Windows”. You want to download version 2021.3.8f1 LTS. A UnityDownloadAssistant-3.8.exe file should be downloaded to your "downloads" folder (where 3.8 is the current Unity version).<br />

<br />

## Compiling the Code and Building the Game
-------------------
- If the code is changed, you will need to recompile the code and rebuild the game. <br />
- Open the unity editor and load the Pong project
- Unity will auto import and compile the code you changed from Visual Studio or VS Code. <br />
- As long as Unity doesn't generate any compilation errors, you can move onto building. <br />
- Click on "file" in the top left corner of the unity editor, then click "Build & Run". <br />
- Unity will automatically compile everything into the necessary files and create one convenient Pong application file that you can click on whenever you would like to   play. Note Unity creates several other files and folders that must be in the same directory of the Pong application for the game to run. <br />
